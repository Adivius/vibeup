# Vibe Up

Vibe Up is a pattern-recognition game that you can play without anyone noticing, because the screen is not used. Your goal is to repeat a sequence of vibrations in the correct order.

## Installation

Download the game at the release tab or at [My website](https://adivius.de/vibeup.html)


## How to Play

1. Start the Game: Tap the screen to begin.
2. Memorize the Pattern: A sequence of vibrations will play. Pay close attention!
3. Repeat the Pattern: Once the vibrations stop, tap the screen in the same order that you felt.
4. Feedback:

   - If you successfully repeat the pattern, you will feel two short vibrations.
   - If you make a mistake, a long vibration will let you know that youâ€™ve lost the round.

5. Keep Playing: Try to last as many rounds as you can by matching the patterns.
